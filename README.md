A LaTeX CV with minor tweaks to moderncv template

This is just a repository for me to synchronize updates to my CV across my different computers.  Most customizations that I have made to @xdanaux's [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) template are borrowed from StackOverflow answers and I  claim no credit for them; I have provided a URL to the respective SO threads in as many cases as possible.
