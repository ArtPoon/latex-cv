\section {Teaching}

Only teaching contributions at Western University are listed.\\

\cventry{2020/7 -- 2021/4}{Seminar Research Project}{MHI4980E}{Department of Pathology}{Western University}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Course coordinator and instructor (26 contact hours).
\item Solicited research proposals from faculty across multiple Departments of Western University.
\item Matched students to proposals/labs following interviews and feedback from both potential supervisors and students.
\item Redeveloped course seminars to focus on practical research skills, \textit{e.g.}, scientific writing, data visualization, identifying journals of high and low quality.
\end{itemize}
}


\cventry{2020/1 -- 2020/4}{Bioinformatics of infectious disease}{MICB4750G}{Department of Microbiology \& Immunology}{Western University}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Course coordinator and instructor (52 contact hours --- 2h lecture, 2h lab per week).
\item Enrolment: 16 students.
\item Revised curriculum:  I developed new lecture materials around the analysis and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in response to the initial spread of the virus in China in January, 2020.  In addition, I modified lab 3 (January 21), to have students analyze the newly published genome sequence using BLAST.
