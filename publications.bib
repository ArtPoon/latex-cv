  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Clinically, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pol sequences are used to evaluate for drug resistance. These data can also be used to evaluate transmission networks and help describe factors associated with transmission risk. METHODS: HIV-1 pol sequences from participants at 5 sites in the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort from 2000-2009 were analyzed for genetic relatedness. Only the first available sequence per participant was included. Inferred transmission networks ("clusters") were defined as ≥2 sequences with ≤1.5\% genetic distance. Clusters including ≥3 patients ("networks") were evaluated for clinical and demographic associations. RESULTS: Of 3697 sequences, 24\% fell into inferred clusters: 155 clusters of 2 individuals ("dyads"), 54 clusters that included 3-14 individuals ("networks"), and 1 large cluster that included 336 individuals across all study sites. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with being in a cluster included not using antiretroviral (ARV) drugs at time of sampling (P < .001), sequence collected after 2004 (P < .001), CD4 cell count >350 cells/mL (P < .01), and viral load 10,000-100,000 copies/mL (P < .001) or >100,000 copies/mL (P < .001). In networks, women were more likely to cluster with other women (P < .001), and African Americans with other African Americans (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular epidemiology can be applied to study HIV transmission networks in geographically and demographically diverse cohorts. Clustering was associated with lack of ARV use and higher viral load, implying transmission may be interrupted by earlier diagnosis and treatment. Observed female and African American networks reinforce the importance of diagnosis and prevention efforts targeted by sex and race.},

  abstract      = {Genetic sequencing ("genotyping") plays a critical role in the modern clinical management of HIV infection. This virus evolves rapidly within patients because of its error-prone reverse transcriptase and short generation time. Consequently, HIV variants with mutations that confer resistance to one or more antiretroviral drugs can emerge during sub-optimal treatment. There are now multiple HIV drug resistance interpretation algorithms that take the region of the HIV genome encoding the major drug targets as inputs; expert use of these algorithms can significantly improve to clinical outcomes in HIV treatment. Next-generation sequencing has the potential to revolutionize HIV resistance genotyping by lowering the threshold that rare but clinically significant HIV variants can be detected reproducibly, and by conferring improved cost-effectiveness in high-throughput scenarios. In this review, we discuss the relative merits and challenges of deploying the Illumina MiSeq instrument for clinical HIV genotyping.},

HSV-2 acquisition was determined by seroconversion on HSV-2 EIA, confirmed by Western blot analysis. Ten men acquired HSV-2 infection a median of 1.3 years after HIV infection (HSV-2 incidence rate of 7.4 per 100 person-years of follow-up). The median time of follow-up after acquiring HSV-2 infection was 303 days. All men except 1 were asymptomatic during HSV-2 acquisition, and only 1 HSV-2 seroconverter, who was asymptomatic, had a transient increase in blood HIV load (0.5 log10 copies/mL over 11 days). The HSV-2 incidence rate was high in our cohort of recently HIV-infected individuals; however, HSV-2 acquisition did not significantly change the plasma HIV dynamics and CD4 cell levels.},

We aimed to develop, validate, and freely disseminate an NS3 clinical sequencing assay to detect the Q80K polymorphism and potentially other HCV NS3 drug resistance mutations. HCV RNA was extracted from frozen plasma using a NucliSENS easyMAG automated nucleic acid extractor, amplified by nested reverse transcription-PCR, and sequenced using Sanger and/or next-generation (MiSeq) methods. Sanger chromatograms were analyzed using in-house software (RECall), and nucleotide mixtures were called automatically. MiSeq reads were iteratively mapped to the H77 reference genome, and consensus NS3 sequences were generated with nucleotides present at >20\% called as mixtures. The accuracy, precision, and sensitivity for detecting the Q80K polymorphism were assessed in 70 samples previously sequenced by an external laboratory. A comparison of the sequences generated by the Sanger and MiSeq methods with those determined by an external lab revealed >98.5\% nucleotide sequence concordance and zero discordant calls of the Q80K polymorphism. The results were both highly repeatable and reproducible (>99.7\% nucleotide concordance and 100\% Q80K concordance). The limits of detection (>2 and ∼5 log10 IU/ml for the Sanger and MiSeq assays, respectively) are sufficiently low to allow genotyping in nearly all chronically infected treatment-naive persons. No systematic bias in the under- or overamplification of minority variants was observed. Coinfection with other viruses (e.g., HIV and hepatitis B virus [HBV]) did not affect the assay results. The two independent HCV NS3 sequencing assays with the automated analysis procedures described here are useful tools to screen for the Q80K polymorphism and other HCV protease inhibitor drug resistance mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {HLA-restricted immune escape mutations that persist following HIV transmission could gradually spread through the viral population, thereby compromising host antiviral immunity as the epidemic progresses. To assess the extent and phenotypic impact of this phenomenon in an immunogenetically diverse population, we genotypically and functionally compared linked HLA and HIV (Gag/Nef) sequences from 358 historic (1979-1989) and 382 modern (2000-2011) specimens from four key cities in the North American epidemic (New York, Boston, San Francisco, Vancouver). Inferred HIV phylogenies were star-like, with approximately two-fold greater mean pairwise distances in modern versus historic sequences. The reconstructed epidemic ancestral (founder) HIV sequence was essentially identical to the North American subtype B consensus. Consistent with gradual diversification of a "consensus-like" founder virus, the median "background" frequencies of individual HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV (in individuals lacking the restricting HLA[s]) were ∼ 2-fold higher in modern versus historic HIV sequences, though these remained notably low overall (e.g. in Gag, medians were 3.7\% in the 2000s versus 2.0\% in the 1980s). HIV polymorphisms exhibiting the greatest relative spread were those restricted by protective HLAs. Despite these increases, when HIV sequences were analyzed as a whole, their total average burden of polymorphisms that were "pre-adapted" to the average host HLA profile was only ∼ 2\% greater in modern versus historic eras. Furthermore, HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in historic HIV sequences were consistent with those detectable today, with none identified that could explain the few HIV codons where the inferred epidemic ancestor differed from the modern consensus. Results are therefore consistent with slow HIV adaptation to HLA, but at a rate unlikely to yield imminent negative implications for cellular immunity, at least in North America. Intriguingly, temporal changes in protein activity of patient-derived Nef (though not Gag) sequences were observed, suggesting functional implications of population-level HIV evolution on certain viral proteins.},

As such, compensatory mutations represent a very specific form of epistasis. We show that intragenic compensatory mutations occur non-randomly over gene sequence. Compensatory mutations are more likely to appear at some sites than others. Moreover, the sites of compensatory mutations are more likely than expected by chance to be near the site of the original deleterious mutation. Furthermore, compensatory mutations tend to occur more commonly in certain regions of the protein even when controlling for clustering around the site of the deleterious mutation. These results suggest that compensatory evolution at the protein level is partially predictable and may be convergent.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Long-acting rilpivirine is a candidate for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for prevention of HIV-1 infection. However, rilpivirine resistance mutations at reverse transcriptase codon 138 (RT-E138X) occur naturally in a minority of HIV-1-infected persons; in particular those expressing Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-B*18 where RT-E138X arises as an immune escape mutation. We investigate the global prevalence, B*18-linkage and replicative cost of RT-E138X and its regional implications for rilpivirine PrEP. METHODS: We analysed linked RT-E138X/HLA data from 7772 antiretroviral-naive patients from 16 cohorts spanning five continents and five HIV-1 subtypes, alongside unlinked global RT-E138X and HLA frequencies from public databases. E138X-containing HIV-1 variants were assessed for in vitro replication as a surrogate of mutation stability following transmission. RESULTS: RT-E138X variants, where the most common were rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations E138A/G/K, were significantly enriched in HLA-B*18-positive individuals globally (p = 3.5 × 10) and in all HIV-1 subtypes except A. RT-E138X and B*18 frequencies correlated positively in 16 cohorts with linked HIV/HLA genotypes (Spearman's R = 0.75; p = 7.6 × 10) and in unlinked HIV/HLA data from 43 countries (Spearman's R = 0.34, p = 0.02). Notably, RT-E138X frequencies approached (or exceeded) 10\% in key epidemic regions (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern Europe) where B*18 is more common. This, along with the observation that RT-E138X variants do not confer in vitro replicative costs, supports their persistence and ongoing accumulation in circulation over time. CONCLUSIONS: Results illustrate the potential for a natural immune-driven HIV-1 polymorphism to compromise antiretroviral-based prevention, particularly in key epidemic regions. Regional RT-E138X surveillance should be undertaken before use of rilpivirine PrEP.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: HIV drug resistance, measured by the genotypic susceptibility score (GSS), has a deleterious effect on the virological outcome of HIV-1-infected patients. However, it is not known if GSS retains any predictive value for CD4 recovery in patients with suppressed viral load. METHODS: Four hundred and six patients on virological failure (>500 copies/mL) with GSS : <6 months prior to switch therapy who achieved undetectable plasma viral load (<50 copies/mL) within 1 year, remained undetectable >1 year on an unchanged regimen and had CD4 data available during entire follow-up were included. Adjusted and unadjusted analyses of all characteristics at switch related to CD4 recovery were made for three time frames: (i) 'switch-suppression'; (ii) 'suppression-1 year'; and (iii) 'switch-1 year'. RESULTS: Higher GSS was associated with a greater CD4 recovery between 'switch' and '1 year' in the unadjusted analysis (P = 0.010); however, the effect of GSS was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for pre-switch clinical (CD4 count and plasma viral load) and demographic variables. Furthermore, only a lower pre-switch CD4 count was associated with increased CD4 recovery in the 'suppression-1 year' period in both unadjusted and adjusted models. The main CD4 recovery occurred in 'switch-suppression' and the variables associated, both unadjusted and adjusted, were CD4 and plasma viral load at switch, maintaining a trend for GSS (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: In individuals who re-suppressed HIV viraemia after switching therapy, regimens having a higher GSS were associated with improved CD4 recovery only during the period from switch to virological suppression, but, once viral load is re-suppressed, the GSS of the new regimen has no further effect on subsequent CD4 recovery.},

  Abstract                 = {Genotypic tropism testing methods are emerging as the first step before prescription of the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) to HIV-infected patients in Europe. Studies validating genotypic tests have included other active drugs that could have potentially convoluted the effects of MVC. The maraviroc clinical test (MCT) is an in vivo drug sensitivity test based on the virological response to a short-term exposure to MVC monotherapy. Thus, our aim was to compare the results of genotypic tropism testing methods with the short-term virological response to MVC monotherapy. A virological response in the MCT was defined as a ≥ 1-log(10) decrease in HIV RNA or undetectability after 8 days of drug exposure. Seventy-three patients undergoing the MCT were included in this study. We used both standard genotypic methods (n = 73) and deep sequencing (n = 27) on MCT samples at baseline. For the standard methods, the most widely used genotypic algorithms for analyzing the V3 loop sequence, geno2pheno and PSSM, were used. For deep sequencing, the geno2pheno algorithm was used with a false-positive rate cutoff of 3.5. The discordance rates between the standard genotypic methods and the virological response were approximately 20\% (including mostly patients without a virological response). Interestingly, these discordance rates were similar to that obtained from deep sequencing (18.5\%). The discordance rates between the genotypic methods (tropism assays predictive of the use of the CCR5 coreceptor) and the MCT (in vivo MVC sensitivity assay) indicate that the algorithms used by genotypic methods are still not sufficiently optimized.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Missense mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are frequently selected in response to therapy; we examined whether silent mutations were also selected for by HIV therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational analysis. Biochemical assays. METHODS: A comparison of the reverse transcriptase gene, from antiretroviral- naive (N = 812) and experienced individuals (N = 2212), reveals two silent mutations (K65K and K66K) that are strongly associated with treatment experience. To assess reverse transcription efficiency, steady-state kinetic assays were carried out using recombinant purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and a series of synthetic RNA/DNA template/primer substrates. The RNA templates spanned codons 60-77 in the reverse transcriptase and included different combinations of mutations at codons 65, 66, 67, and 70. RESULTS: Silent AAG mutations (or mixtures) at reverse transcriptase codons 65 and/or 66 were observed in 812 samples from 351 patients and 2129 samples from 829 patients, respectively. In clade B samples, there was a very strong relationship between the silent mutations and the thymidine analogue mutations, in particular D67N. Steady-state kinetic experiments demonstrated that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase exhibited a strong tendency to pause and/or dissociate at codons 65 and 66 on RNA templates that contained the D67N and K70R mutations. However, when the K66 or K66 AAA to AAG mutations were added to the background of the 67 and 70 mutational changes, these pausing and/or dissociation events were largely alleviated. CONCLUSION: Silent mutations at codons 65 and/or 66 are strongly coselected with thymidine analogue mutations. These data provide the first evidence for an RNA-level mechanism of direct relevance to drug resistance.},

Phylogenetic clustering and associated factors were evaluated among PWID in Vancouver, Canada. Data were derived from the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study. Participants who were HCV antibody-positive at enrolment and those with HCV antibody seroconversion during follow-up (1996 to 2012) were tested for HCV RNA and sequenced (Core-E2 region). Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum likelihood analysis and clusters were identified using ClusterPicker (90\% bootstrap threshold, 0.05 genetic distance threshold). Factors associated with clustering were assessed using logistic regression. Among 655 eligible participants, HCV genotype prevalence was: G1a: 48\% (n=313), G1b: 6\% (n=41), G2a: 3\% (n=20), G2b: 7\% (n=46), G3a: 33\% (n=213), G4a: <1\% (n=4), G6a: 1\% (n=8), G6e: <1\% (n=1), and unclassifiable: 1\% (n=9). The mean age was 36 years, 162 (25\%) were female, and 164 (25\%) were HIV+. Among 501 participants with HCV G1a and G3a, 31\% (n=156) were in a pair/cluster. Factors independently associated with phylogenetic clustering included: age <40 (versus age≥40, adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.64; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 2.63), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AOR=1.82; 95\% CI 1.18, 2.81), HCV seroconversion (AOR=3.05; 95\% CI 1.40, 6.66), and recent syringe borrowing (AOR 1.59; 95\% CI 1.07, 2.36). CONCLUSION: In this sample of PWID, one-third demonstrated phylogenetic clustering. Factors independently associated with phylogenetic clustering included younger age, recent HCV seroconversion, prevalent HIV infection, and recent syringe borrowing. Strategies to enhance the delivery of prevention and/or treatment strategies to those with HIV and recent HCV seroconversion should be explored, given an increased likelihood of HCV transmission in these subpopulations.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Understanding HCV transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID) is important for designing prevention strategies. This study investigated whether HCV infection among younger injectors occurs from few or many transmission events from older injectors to younger injectors among PWID in Vancouver, Canada. METHODS: HCV antibody positive participants at enrolment or follow-up (1996-2012) were tested for HCV RNA and sequenced (Core-E2). Time-stamped phylogenetic trees were inferred using Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST). Association of age with phylogeny was tested using statistics implemented in the software Bayesian Tip Significance (BaTS) testing. Factors associated with clustering (maximum cluster age: five years) were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 699 participants with HCV subtype 1a, 1b, 2b and 3a infection (26\% female, 24\% HIV+): 21\% were younger (<27years), and 10\% had recent HCV seroconversion. When inferred cluster age was limited to <5years, 15\% (n=108) were in clusters/pairs. Although a moderate degree of segregation was observed between younger and older participants, there was also transmission between age groups. Younger age (<27 vs. >40, AOR: 3.14; 95\% CI: 1.54, 6.39), HIV (AOR: 1.97; 95\% CI: 1.22, 3.18) and subtype 3a (AOR: 2.12; 95\% CI: 1.33, 3.38) were independently associated with clustering. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of PWID from Vancouver, HCV among young injectors was seeded from many transmission events between HCV-infected older and younger injectors.

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: The timing of the initial spread of hepatitis C virus genotype 1a in North America is controversial. In particular, how and when hepatitis C virus reached extraordinary prevalence in specific demographic groups remains unclear. We quantified, using all available hepatitis C virus sequence data and phylodynamic methods, the timing of the spread of hepatitis C virus genotype 1a in North America. METHODS: We screened 45 316 publicly available sequences of hepatitis C virus genotype 1a for location and genotype, and then did phylogenetic analyses of available North American sequences from five hepatitis C virus genes (E1, E2, NS2, NS4B, NS5B), with an emphasis on including as many sequences with early collection dates as possible. We inferred the historical population dynamics of this epidemic for all five gene regions using Bayesian skyline plots. FINDINGS: Most of the spread of genotype 1a in North America occurred before 1965, and the hepatitis C virus epidemic has undergone relatively little expansion since then. The effective population size of the North American epidemic stabilised around 1960. These results were robust across all five gene regions analysed, although analyses of each gene separately show substantial variation in estimates of the timing of the early exponential growth, ranging roughly from 1940 for NS2, to 1965 for NS4B. INTERPRETATION: The expansion of genotype 1a before 1965 suggests that nosocomial or iatrogenic factors rather than past sporadic behavioural risk (ie, experimentation with injection drug use, unsafe tattooing, high risk sex, travel to high endemic areas) were key contributors to the hepatitis C virus epidemic in North America. Our results might reduce stigmatisation around screening and diagnosis, potentially increasing rates of screening and treatment for hepatitis C virus.

  Abstract                 = {UNLABELLED: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-associated polymorphisms in HIV-1 that persist upon transmission to HLA-mismatched hosts may spread in the population as the epidemic progresses. Transmission of HIV-1 sequences containing such adaptations may undermine cellular immune responses to the incoming virus in future hosts. Building upon previous work, we investigated the extent of HLA-associated polymorphism accumulation in HIV-1 polymerase (Pol) through comparative analysis of linked HIV-1/HLA class I genotypes sampled during historic (1979 to 1989; n = 338) and modern (2001 to 2011; n = 278) eras from across North America (Vancouver, BC, Canada; Boston, MA; New York, NY; and San Francisco, CA). Phylogenies inferred from historic and modern HIV-1 Pol sequences were star-like in shape, with an inferred most recent common ancestor (epidemic founder virus) sequence nearly identical to the modern North American subtype B consensus sequence. Nevertheless, modern HIV-1 Pol sequences exhibited roughly 2-fold-higher patristic (tip-to-tip) genetic distances than historic sequences, with HLA pressures likely driving ongoing diversification. Moreover, the frequencies of published HLA-associated polymorphisms in individuals lacking the selecting HLA class I allele was on average ∼2.5-fold higher in the modern than in the historic era, supporting their spread in circulation, though some remained stable in frequency during this time. Notably, polymorphisms restricted by protective HLA alleles appear to be spreading to a greater relative extent than others, though these increases are generally of modest absolute magnitude. However, despite evidence of polymorphism spread, North American hosts generally remain at relatively low risk of acquiring an HIV-1 polymerase sequence substantially preadapted to their HLA profiles, even in the present era. IMPORTANCE: HLA class I-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in HIV-1 that persist upon transmission may accumulate in circulation over time, potentially undermining host antiviral immunity to the transmitted viral strain. We studied >600 experimentally collected HIV-1 polymerase sequences linked to host HLA information dating back to 1979, along with phylogenetically reconstructed HIV-1 sequences dating back to the virus' introduction into North America. Overall, our results support the gradual spread of many-though not all-HIV-1 polymerase immune escape mutations in circulation over time. This is consistent with recent observations from other global regions, though the extent of polymorphism accumulation in North America appears to be lower than in populations with high seroprevalence, older epidemics, and/or limited HLA diversity. Importantly, the risk of acquiring an HIV-1 polymerase sequence at transmission that is substantially preadapted to one's HLA profile remains relatively low in North America, even in the present era.},

  Abstract                 = {Initial in vitro studies of bevirimat resistance failed to observe mutations in the clinically significant QVT motif in SP1 of HIV-1 gag. This study presents a novel screening method involving mixed, clinically derived gag-protease recombinant HIV-1 samples to more accurately mimic the selection of resistance seen in vivo. Bevirimat resistance was investigated via population-based sequencing performed with a large, initially antiretroviral-na{\"\i}ve cohort before (n = 805) and after (n = 355) standard HIV therapy (without bevirimat). The prevalence of any polymorphism in the motif comprising Q, V, and T was ∼ 6\%, 29\%, and 12\%, respectively, and did not change appreciably over the course of therapy. From these samples, three groups of 10 samples whose bulk sequences were wild type at the QVT motif were used to generate gag-protease recombinant viruses that captured the existing diversity. Groups were mixed and passaged with various bevirimat concentrations for 9 weeks. gag variations were assessed by amplicon-based "deep" sequencing using a GS FLX sequencer (Roche). Unscreened mutations were present in all groups, and a V370A minority not originally detected by bulk sequencing was present in one group. V370A, occurring together with another preexisting, unscreened resistance mutation, was selected in all groups in the presence of a bevirimat concentration above 0.1 μM. For the two groups with V370A levels below consistent detectability by deep sequencing, the initial selection of V370A required 3 to 4 weeks of exposure to a narrow range of bevirimat concentrations, whereas for the group with the V370A minority, selection occurred immediately. This approach provides quasispecies diversity that facilitates the selection of mutations observed in clinical trials and, coupled with deep sequencing, could represent an efficient in vitro screening method for detecting resistance mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) V3 loop sequence can be used to infer viral coreceptor use. The effect of input copy number on population-based sequencing of the V3 loop of HIV-1 was examined through replicate deep and population-based sequencing of samples with known tropism, a heterogeneous clinical sample (624 population-based sequences and 47 deep-sequencing replicates), and a large cohort of clinical samples from phase III clinical trials of maraviroc including the MOTIVATE/A4001029 studies (n = 1,521). Proviral DNA from two independent samples from each of 101 patients from the MOTIVATE/A4001029 studies was also analyzed. Cumulative technical error occurred at a rate of 3 × 10(-4) mismatches/bp, without observed effect on inferred tropism. Increasing PCR replication increased minority species detection with an ~10\% minority population detected in 18\% of cases using a single replicate at a viral load of 1,072 copies/ml and in 44\% of cases using three replicates. The nucleotide prevalence detected by population-based and deep sequencing were highly correlated (Spearman's ρ, 0.73), and the accuracy increased with increasing input copy number (P < 0.001). Triplicate sequencing was able to predict tropism changes in the MOTIVATE/A4001029 studies for both low (P = 0.05) and high (P = 0.02) viral loads. Sequences derived from independently extracted and processed samples of proviral DNA for the same patient were equivalent to replicates from the same extraction (P = 0.45) and had correlated position-specific scoring matrix scores (Spearman's ρ, 0.75; P < 0.001); however, concordance in tropism inference was only 83\%. Input copy number and PCR replication are important factors in minority species detection in samples with significant heterogeneity.},

  Abstract                 = {Next generation, "deep", sequencing has increasing applications both clinically and in disparate fields of research. This study investigates the accuracy and reproducibility of "deep" sequencing as applied to co-receptor prediction using the V3 loop of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1. Despite increasing use in HIV co-receptor prediction, the accuracy and reproducibility of deep sequencing technology, and the factors which can affect it, have received only a limited level of investigation. To accomplish this, repeated deep sequencing results were generated using the Roche GS-FLX (454) from a number of sources including a non-homogeneous clinical sample (N = 47 replicates over 18 deep sequencing runs), and a large clinical cohort from the MOTIVATE and A400129 studies (N = 1521). For repeated measurements of a non-homogeneous clinical sample, increasing input copy number both decreased variance in the measured proportion of non-R5 using virus (p<0.001 and 0.02 for single replicates and triplicates respectively) and increased measured viral diversity (p<0.001; multiple measures). Detection of sequences with a mean abundance less than 1\% abundance showed a 2 fold increase in median coefficient of variation (CV) in repeated measurements of a non-homogeneous clinical sample, and a 2.7 fold increase in CV in the MOTIVATE/A400129 dataset compared to sequences with ≥1\% abundance. An unexpected source of error included read position, with low accuracy reads occurring more frequently towards the edge of sequencing regions (p<0.001). Overall, the primary source of variability was sampling error caused by low input copy number/minority species prevalence, though other sources of error including sequence intrinsic, temporal, and read-position related errors were detected.},

We applied DEPS to alignments representing different genomic regions of influenza A virus (IAV), sampled from avian hosts (H5N1 serotype) and human hosts (H3N2 serotype), and identified multiple directionally evolving sites in 5/8 genomic segments of H5N1 and H3N2 IAV. We propose a simple descriptive classification of directionally evolving sites into 5 groups based on the temporal distribution of residue frequencies and document known functional correlates, such as immune escape or host adaptation.},

Statistical models applied to HIV-1 sequence data can help to elucidate the nature of these selection pressures through comparisons of non-synonymous (or amino acid changing) and synonymous (or amino acid preserving) substitution rates. These models also need to take into account the non-independence of sequences due to their shared evolutionary history. We review how we have developed these methods and have applied them to characterize the evolution of HIV-1 in vivo. To illustrate our methods, we present an analysis of compartment-specific evolution of HIV-1 env in blood and cerebrospinal fluid and of site-to-site variation in the gag gene of subtype C HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetically diverse pathogens (such as Human Immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV-1) are frequently stratified into phylogenetically or immunologically defined subtypes for classification purposes. Computational identification of such subtypes is helpful in surveillance, epidemiological analysis and detection of novel variants, e.g., circulating recombinant forms in HIV-1. A number of conceptually and technically different techniques have been proposed for determining the subtype of a query sequence, but there is not a universally optimal approach. We present a model-based phylogenetic method for automatically subtyping an HIV-1 (or other viral or bacterial) sequence, mapping the location of breakpoints and assigning parental sequences in recombinant strains as well as computing confidence levels for the inferred quantities. Our Subtype Classification Using Evolutionary ALgorithms (SCUEAL) procedure is shown to perform very well in a variety of simulation scenarios, runs in parallel when multiple sequences are being screened, and matches or exceeds the performance of existing approaches on typical empirical cases. We applied SCUEAL to all available polymerase (pol) sequences from two large databases, the Stanford Drug Resistance database and the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database. Comparing with subtypes which had previously been assigned revealed that a minor but substantial (approximately 5\%) fraction of pure subtype sequences may in fact be within- or inter-subtype recombinants. A free implementation of SCUEAL is provided as a module for the HyPhy package and the Datamonkey web server. Our method is especially useful when an accurate automatic classification of an unknown strain is desired, and is positioned to complement and extend faster but less accurate methods. Given the increasingly frequent use of HIV subtype information in studies focusing on the effect of subtype on treatment, clinical outcome, pathogenicity and vaccine design, the importance of accurate, robust and extensible subtyping procedures is clear.},

  Abstract                 = {The difference between regional rates of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in patients infected with different subtypes of HIV suggests that genetic determinants exist within HIV that influence the ability of the virus to replicate in the central nervous system (in Uganda, Africa, subtype D HAD rate is 89\%, while subtype A HAD rate is 24\%). HIV-1 nef is a multifunctional protein with known toxic effects in the brain compartment. The goal of the current study was to identify if specific three-dimensional nef structures may be linked to patients who developed HAD. HIV-1 nef structures were computationally derived for consensus brain and non-brain sequences from a panel of patients infected with subtype B who died due to varied disease pathologies and consensus subtype A and subtype D sequences from Uganda. Site directed mutation analysis identified signatures in brain structures that appear to change binding potentials and could affect folding conformations of brain-associated structures. Despite the large sequence variation between HIV subtypes, structural alignments confirmed that viral structures derived from patients with HAD were more similar to subtype D structures than to structures derived from patient sequences without HAD. Furthermore, structures derived from brain sequences of patients with HAD were more similar to subtype D structures than they were to their own non-brain structures. The potential finding of a brain-specific nef structure indicates that HAD may result from genetic alterations that alter the folding or binding potential of the protein.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequencing is important for understanding the molecular epidemiology and viral evolution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. To date, there is little standardisation among sequencing protocols, in-part due to the high genetic diversity that is observed within HCV. This study aimed to develop a novel, practical sequencing protocol that covered both conserved and variable regions of the viral genome and assess the influence of each subregion, sequence concatenation and unrelated reference sequences on phylogenetic clustering analysis. The Core to the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of envelope-2 (E2) and non-structural-5B (NS5B) regions of the HCV genome were amplified and sequenced from participants from the Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC), a prospective study of the natural history and treatment of recent HCV infection. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using a general time-reversible substitution model and sensitivity analyses were completed for every subregion. Pairwise distance, genetic distance and bootstrap support were computed to assess the impact of HCV region on clustering results as measured by the identification and percentage of participants falling within all clusters, cluster size, average patristic distance, and bootstrap value. The Robinson-Foulds metrics was also used to compare phylogenetic trees among the different HCV regions. Our results demonstrated that the genomic region of HCV analysed influenced phylogenetic tree topology and clustering results. The HCV Core region alone was not suitable for clustering analysis; NS5B concatenation, the inclusion of reference sequences and removal of HVR1 all influenced clustering outcome. The Core-E2 region, which represented the highest genetic diversity and longest sequence length in this study, provides an ideal method for clustering analysis to address a range of molecular epidemiological questions.},

An efficient protocol to address this issue must be established to minimize negative therapeutic outcomes for HIV-1-infected individuals in such settings. This is an observational study to ascertain the potential of newer genomic sequencing platforms, such as the Illumina MiSeq instrument, to provide accurate HIV drug resistance genotypes for hundreds of samples simultaneously. Plasma samples were collected from Canadian patients during routine drug resistance testing (n = 759) and from a Ugandan study cohort (n = 349). Amplicons spanning HIV reverse transcriptase codons 90 to 234 were sequenced with both MiSeq sequencing and conventional Sanger sequencing methods. Sequences were evaluated for nucleotide concordance between methods, using coverage and mixture parameters for quality control. Consensus sequences were also analyzed for disparities in the identification of drug resistance mutations. Sanger and MiSeq sequencing was successful for 881 samples (80\%) and 892 samples (81\%), respectively, with 832 samples having results from both methods. Most failures were for samples with viral loads of <3.0 log10 HIV RNA copies/ml. Overall, 99.3\% nucleotide concordance between methods was observed. MiSeq sequencing achieved 97.4\% sensitivity and 99.3\% specificity in detecting resistance mutations identified by Sanger sequencing.

The evolutionary dynamics of X4 infections however, remain incompletely understood. We identified two individuals, one CCR5wt/wt and one CCR5∆32/∆32, within the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who were infected with a genetically similar X4 HIV-1 strain. While early-stage plasma viral loads were comparable in the two individuals (~4.5-5 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml), CD4 counts in the CCR5wt/wt individual reached a nadir of <20 CD4 cells/mm(3) within 17 months but remained >250 cells/mm(3) in the CCR5∆32/∆32 individual. Ancestral phylogenetic reconstructions using longitudinal envelope-V3 deep sequences suggested that both individuals were infected by a single transmitted/founder (T/F) X4 virus that differed at only one V3 site (codon 24). While substantial within-host HIV-1 V3 diversification was observed in plasma and PBMC in both individuals, the CCR5wt/wt individual's HIV-1 population gradually reverted from 100\% X4 to ~60\% R5 over ~4 years whereas the CCR5∆32/∆32 individual's remained consistently X4. Our observations illuminate early dynamics of X4 HIV-1 infections and underscore the influence of CCR5 genotype on HIV-1 V3 evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 tropism can be predicted using V3 genotypic algorithms. The performance of these prediction algorithms for non-B subtypes is poorly characterized. Here, we use these genotypic algorithms to predict viral tropism of HIV-1 subtype A, B, C, and D to find apparent sensitivity, specificity, and concordance against a recombinant phenotypic assay, the original Trofile assay. This is a substudy of an epidemiological study (Pfizer A4001064). Plasma samples were selected to represent a large number of DM/X4 and R5 viruses. The HIV-1 env gene V3 loop was genotyped by Sanger sequencing (N=260) or 454 "deep" sequencing (N=280). Sequences were scored with g2p[coreceptor], PSSM X4/R5, PSSM SI/NSI, and PSSM subtype C matrices. Overall, non-B subtypes tropism prediction had similar concordance and apparent sensitivity and specificity as subtype B in predicting Trofile's results in both population sequencing (81.3\%, 65.6\%, and 90.5\% versus 84.2\%, 78.5\%, and 88.2\%) and 454 "deep" sequencing (82.3\%, 80.0\%, and 83.6\% versus 86.8\%, 92.0\%, and 82.6\%) using g2p[coreceptor]. By population sequencing, subtype A had lower sensitivity, whereas subtype D had lower specificity for non-R5 predictions, both in comparison to subtype B. 454 "deep" sequencing improved subtype A sensitivity but not subtype D. Subtype C had greater concordance than subtype B regardless of sequencing methods. In conclusion, genotypic tropism prediction algorithms may be applied to non-B HIV-1 subtypes with caution. Collective analysis of non-B subtypes revealed a performance similar to subtype B, whereas a subtype-specific analysis revealed overestimation (subtype D) or underestimation (subtype A).},

However, the viral population and diversity in other body compartments such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) remains poorly understood. Previous studies have mostly focused on protease and reverse transcriptase drug resistance mutations (DRMs). In this study, we used 454 "deep" sequencing technology to observe and quantify longitudinally the prevalence of resistance mutations associated with the integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, in plasma versus PBMC samples from a San Francisco-based cohort. Four heavily treatment-experienced subjects were monitored in this study over a median of 1.2 years since the initiation of raltegravir-containing regimens. We observed a consistent discordance in the prevalence of DRMs, but not resistance pathway(s), in the plasma versus PBMC viral populations. In the final paired samples that were tested while the subjects were on a raltegravir-containing regimen, DRM prevalence reached 100\% in plasma but remained 1\% in PBMC on day 177 post-therapy in Subject 3180 (Q148H/G140S), 100\% in plasma and 36\% in PBMC on day 224 in Subject 3242 (N155H), 78\% in plasma and 11-12\% in PBMC on day 338 in Subject 3501 (Q148H/G140S), and 100\% in plasma and 0\% in PBMC on day 197 in Subject 3508 (Y143R). Furthermore, absolute sequence homology comparison between the two compartments revealed that 21\% - 99\% of PBMC sequences had no match in plasma, whereas 14\% - 100\% of plasma sequences had no match in PBMC. Overall, our observations suggested that plasma and PBMC hosted drastically different HIV-1 populations even after a prolonged exposure to raltegravir selection pressure.},

  abstract      = {Primer IDs (pIDs) are random oligonucleotide tags used in next-generation sequencing to identify sequences that originate from the same template. These tags are produced by degenerate primers during the reverse transcription of RNA molecules into cDNA. The use of pIDs helps to track the number of RNA molecules carried through amplification and sequencing, and allows resolution of inconsistencies between reads sharing a pID. Three potential issues complicate the above applications. First, multiple cDNAs may share a pID by chance; we found that while preventing any cDNAs from sharing a pID may be unfeasible, it is still practical to limit the number of these collisions. Secondly, a pID must be observed in at least three sequences to allow error correction; as such, pIDs observed only one or two times must be rejected. If the sequencing product contains copies from a high number of RT templates but produces few reads, our findings indicate that rejecting such pIDs will discard a great deal of data. Thirdly, the use of pIDs could influence amplification and sequencing. We examined the effects of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors on sequencing reads at both the individual and ensemble level.},

However, HPAI H5N1 strains are not equally virulent in mammals, and some strains have been shown to cause only mild symptoms in experimental infections. Since most experimental studies of the basis of virulence in mammals have been small in scale, we undertook a meta-analysis of available experimental studies and used Bayesian graphical models (BGM) to increase the power of inference. We applied text-mining techniques to identify 27 individual studies that experimentally determined pathogenicity in HPAI H5N1 strains comprising 69 complete genome sequences. Amino acid sequence data in all 11 genes were coded as binary data for the presence or absence of mutations related to virulence in mammals or nonconsensus residues. Sites previously implicated as virulence determinants were examined for association with virulence in mammals in this data set, and the sites with the most significant association were selected for further BGM analysis. The analyses show that virulence in mammals is a complex genetic trait directly influenced by mutations in polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and PB2, nonstructural 1 (NS1), and hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Several intra- and intersegment correlations were also found, and we postulate that there may be two separate virulence mechanisms involving particular combinations of polymerase and NS1 mutations or of NS1 and HA mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Most of our knowledge about how antiretrovirals and host immune responses influence the HIV-1 protease gene is derived from studies of subtype B virus. We investigated the effect of protease resistance-associated mutations (PRAMs) and population-based HLA haplotype frequencies on polymorphisms found in CRF01\_AE pro. METHODS: We used all CRF01\_AE protease sequences retrieved from the LANL database and obtained regional HLA frequencies from the dbMHC database. Polymorphisms and major PRAMs in the sequences were identified using the Stanford Resistance Database, and we performed phylogenetic and selection analyses using HyPhy. HLA binding affinities were estimated using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 99\% of CRF01\_AE sequences had at least 1 polymorphism and 10\% had at least 1 major PRAM. Three polymorphisms (L10 V, K20RMI and I62 V) were associated with the presence of a major PRAM (P < 0.05). Compared to the subtype B consensus, six additional polymorphisms (I13 V, E35D, M36I, R41K, H69K, L89M) were identified in the CRF01\_AE consensus; all but L89M were located within epitopes recognized by HLA class I alleles. Of the predominant HLA haplotypes in the Asian regions of CRF01\_AE origin, 80\% were positively associated with the observed polymorphisms, and estimated HLA binding affinity was estimated to decrease 19-40 fold with the observed polymorphisms at positions 35, 36 and 41. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in CRF01\_AE protease gene were common, and polymorphisms at residues 10, 20 and 62 most likely represent selection by use of protease inhibitors, whereas R41K and H69K were more likely attributable to recognition of epitopes by the HLA haplotypes of the host population.},

  abstract      = {UNLABELLED: A population of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) within a host often descends from a single transmitted/founder virus. The high mutation rate of HIV, coupled with long delays between infection and diagnosis, make isolating and characterizing this strain a challenge. In theory, ancestral reconstruction could be used to recover this strain from sequences sampled in chronic infection; however, the accuracy of phylogenetic techniques in this context is unknown. To evaluate the accuracy of these methods, we applied ancestral reconstruction to a large panel of published longitudinal clonal and/or single-genome-amplification HIV sequence data sets with at least one intrapatient sequence set sampled within 6 months of infection or seroconversion (n = 19,486 sequences, median [interquartile range] = 49 [20 to 86] sequences/set). The consensus of the earliest sequences was used as the best possible estimate of the transmitted/founder. These sequences were compared to ancestral reconstructions from sequences sampled at later time points using both phylogenetic and phylogeny-naive methods. Overall, phylogenetic methods conferred a 16\% improvement in reproducing the consensus of early sequences, compared to phylogeny-naive methods. This relative advantage increased with intrapatient sequence diversity (P < 10(-5)) and the time elapsed between the earliest and subsequent samples (P < 10(-5)). However, neither approach performed well for reconstructing ancestral indel variation, especially within indel-rich regions of the HIV genome. Although further improvements are needed, our results indicate that phylogenetic methods for ancestral reconstruction significantly outperform phylogeny-naive alternatives, and we identify experimental conditions and study designs that can enhance accuracy of transmitted/founder virus reconstruction. IMPORTANCE: When HIV is transmitted into a new host, most of the viruses fail to infect host cells. Consequently, an HIV infection tends to be descended from a single "founder" virus. A priority target for the vaccine research, these transmitted/founder viruses are difficult to isolate since newly infected individuals are often unaware of their status for months or years, by which time the virus population has evolved substantially. Here, we report on the potential use of evolutionary methods to reconstruct the genetic sequence of the transmitted/founder virus from its descendants at later stages of an infection. These methods can recover this ancestral sequence with an overall error rate of about 2.3\%-about 15\% more information than if we had ignored the evolutionary relationships among viruses. Although there is no substitute for sampling infections at earlier points in time, these methods can provide useful information about the genetic makeup of transmitted/founder HIV.},

  abstract      = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a naturally occurring polymorphism, Q80K, in the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) gene encoding the viral protease, which has been associated with reduced susceptibility to the direct-acting antiviral inhibitor simeprevir. Q80K is observed predominantly in HCV genotype 1a and seldom in other HCV genotypes; moreover, it has a markedly high prevalence in the United States. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of this polymorphism to investigate why it is so highly localized in prevalence and whether it is stably transmitted between hosts. We found that the majority (96\%) of HCV infections carrying Q80K were descended from a single lineage in which a Q80K substitution occurred around the 1940s in the United States, which implies that this polymorphism is likely highly transmissible. Furthermore, we identified 2 other substitutions in NS3 that may interact with Q80K and contribute to its stability. Our results imply that the current distribution and prevalence of Q80K are unlikely to change significantly in the short term.},

  abstract      = {Models of the spread of disease in a population often make the simplifying assumption that the population is homogeneously mixed, or is divided into homogeneously mixed compartments. However, human populations have complex structures formed by social contacts, which can have a significant influence on the rate of epidemic spread. Contact network models capture this structure by explicitly representing each contact which could possibly lead to a transmission. We developed a method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a likelihood-free inference strategy, for estimating structural parameters of the contact network underlying an observed viral phylogeny. The method combines adaptive sequential Monte Carlo for ABC, Gillespie simulation for propagating epidemics though networks, and a kernel-based tree similarity score. We used the method to fit the Barab{\'a}si-Albert network model to simulated transmission trees, and also applied it to viral phylogenies estimated from ten published HIV sequence datasets. This model incorporates a feature called preferential attachment (PA), whereby individuals with more existing contacts accumulate new contacts at a higher rate. On simulated data, we found that the strength of PA and the number of infected nodes in the network can often be accurately estimated. On the other hand, the mean degree of the network, as well as the total number of nodes, was not estimable with ABC. We observed sub-linear PA power in all datasets, as well as higher PA power in networks of injection drug users. These results underscore the importance of considering contact structures when performing phylodynamic inference. Our method offers the potential to quantitatively investigate the contact network structure underlying viral epidemics.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Using deep sequencing methods, we intensively investigated the selective pressure of maraviroc on the viral population in four patients with dual/mixed HIV-1 experiencing treatment failure. METHODS: Patients received maraviroc add-on therapy (n = 4). Tropism was determined by Monogram's Trofile assay and/or 'deep' sequencing. Longitudinal 'deep' sequence analysis used triplicate HIV V3 RT-PCR on plasma samples. Sequences were interpreted using the geno2phenocoreceptor algorithm with a 3.5\% false-positive rate (FPR) cut-off. RESULTS: Patients had a median viral load of 4.7 log10 HIV RNA copies/mL with a median of 24\% chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using virus at baseline. Following maraviroc exposure, the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5)-using virus (R5) plasma viral load decreased by at least 1 log10, and only non-R5 variants with extremely low FPR values predominated after 21 days. Virus with an FPR ≤1.8\% accounted for more than 90\% of the circulating virus, having expanded to occupy the 'space' left by the suppression of R5 variants. Population genetic estimates of viral fitness in the presence of maraviroc showed a steep rise around an FPR value of 2\%. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis of independent R5 and non-R5 HIV populations shows that maraviroc selects viruses with an extremely low FPR, implying that the antiviral activity of maraviroc may extend to a broader range of HIV variants than previously suspected.},

  Abstract                 = {Effective surveillance and treatment strategies are required to control the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic. Phylogenetic analyses are powerful tools for reconstructing the evolutionary history of viral outbreaks and identifying transmission clusters. These studies often rely on Sanger sequencing which typically generates a single consensus sequence for each infected individual. For rapidly mutating viruses such as HCV, consensus sequencing underestimates the complexity of the viral quasispecies population and could therefore generate different phylogenetic tree topologies. Although deep sequencing provides a more detailed quasispecies characterization, in-depth phylogenetic analyses are challenging due to dataset complexity and computational limitations. Here, we apply deep sequencing to a characterized population to assess its ability to identify phylogenetic clusters compared with consensus Sanger sequencing. For deep sequencing, a sample specific threshold determined by the 50th percentile of the patristic distance distribution for all variants within each individual was used to identify clusters. Among seven patristic distance thresholds tested for the Sanger sequence phylogeny ranging from 0.005-0.06, a threshold of 0.03 was found to provide the maximum balance between positive agreement (samples in a cluster) and negative agreement (samples not in a cluster) relative to the deep sequencing dataset. From 77 HCV seroconverters, 10 individuals were identified in phylogenetic clusters using both methods. Deep sequencing analysis identified an additional 4 individuals and excluded 8 other individuals relative to Sanger sequencing. The application of this deep sequencing approach could be a more effective tool to understand onward HCV transmission dynamics compared with Sanger sequencing, since the incorporation of minority sequence variants improves the discrimination of phylogenetically linked clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses have genomes that are potentially capable of forming complex secondary structures through Watson-Crick base pairing between their constituent nucleotides. A few of the structural elements formed by such base pairings are, in fact, known to have important functions during the replication of many ssDNA viruses. Unknown, however, are (i) whether numerous additional ssDNA virus genomic structural elements predicted to exist by computational DNA folding methods actually exist and (ii) whether those structures that do exist have any biological relevance. We therefore computationally inferred lists of the most evolutionarily conserved structures within a diverse selection of animal- and plant-infecting ssDNA viruses drawn from the families Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Parvoviridae, Nanoviridae, and Geminiviridae and analyzed these for evidence of natural selection favoring the maintenance of these structures. While we find evidence that is consistent with purifying selection being stronger at nucleotide sites that are predicted to be base paired than at sites predicted to be unpaired, we also find strong associations between sites that are predicted to pair with one another and site pairs that are apparently coevolving in a complementary fashion. Collectively, these results indicate that natural selection actively preserves much of the pervasive secondary structure that is evident within eukaryote-infecting ssDNA virus genomes and, therefore, that much of this structure is biologically functional. Lastly, we provide examples of various highly conserved but completely uncharacterized structural elements that likely have important functions within some of the ssDNA virus genomes analyzed here.},

Sanger sequencing (HCV NS5B, HVR1 and Core-E1-HVR1) and phylogenetics were applied to samples from individuals diagnosed with HCV in British Columbia, Canada in 2011. This included individuals with two or three sequential samples collected <1 year apart. Patristic distances between sequential samples were used to set cutoffs to identify recent transmission clusters. Factors associated with transmission clustering were analyzed using logistic regression. From 618 individuals, 646 sequences were obtained. Depending on the cutoff used, 63 (10\%) to 92 (15\%) unique individuals were identified within transmission clusters of predicted recent origin. Clustered individuals were more likely to be <40 years old (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 2.12, 95\% CI 1.21-3.73), infected with genotype 1a (AOR 6.60, 95\% CI 1.98-41.0), and to be seroconverters with estimated infection duration of <1 year (AOR 3.13, 95\% CI 1.29-7.36) or >1 year (AOR 2.19, 95\% CI 1.22-3.97). CONCLUSION: Systematic application of molecular phylogenetics may be used to enhance traditional surveillance methods through identification of recent transmission clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {Over time, natural selection molds every gene into a unique mosaic of sites evolving rapidly or resisting change-an "evolutionary fingerprint" of the gene. Aspects of this evolutionary fingerprint, such as the site-specific ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS), are commonly used to identify genetic features of potential biological interest; however, no framework exists for comparing evolutionary fingerprints between genes. We hypothesize that protein-coding genes with similar protein structure and/or function tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints and that comparing evolutionary fingerprints can be useful for discovering similarities between genes in a way that is analogous to, but independent of, discovery of similarity via sequence-based comparison tools such as Blast. To test this hypothesis, we develop a novel model of coding sequence evolution that uses a general bivariate discrete parameterization of the evolutionary rates. We show that this approach provides a better fit to the data using a smaller number of parameters than existing models. Next, we use the model to represent evolutionary fingerprints as probability distributions and present a methodology for comparing these distributions in a way that is robust against variations in data set size and divergence. Finally, using sequences of three rapidly evolving RNA viruses (HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, and influenza A virus), we demonstrate that genes within the same functional group tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints. Our framework provides a sound statistical foundation for efficient inference and comparison of evolutionary rate patterns in arbitrary collections of gene alignments, clustering homologous and nonhomologous genes, and investigation of biological and functional correlates of evolutionary rates.},

  Abstract                 = {A compensatory mutation occurs when the fitness loss caused by one mutation is remedied by its epistatic interaction with a second mutation at a different site in the genome. This poorly understood biological phenomenon has important implications, not only for the evolutionary consequences of mutation, but also for the genetic complexity of adaptation. We have carried out the first direct experimental measurement of the average rate of compensatory mutation. An arbitrary selection of 21 missense substitutions with deleterious effects on fitness was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the bacteriophage phiX174. For each deleterious mutation, we evolved 8-16 replicate populations to determine the frequency at which a compensatory mutation, instead of the back mutation, was acquired to recover fitness. The overall frequency of compensatory mutation was approximately 70\%. Deleterious mutations that were more severe were significantly more likely to be compensated for. Furthermore, experimental reversion of deleterious mutations revealed that compensatory mutations have deleterious effects in a wild-type background. A large diversity of intragenic compensatory mutations was identified from sequencing fitness-recovering genotypes. Subsequent analyses of intragenic mutation diversity revealed a significant degree of clustering around the deleterious mutation in the linear sequence and also within folded protein structures. Moreover, a likelihood analysis of mutation diversity predicts that, on average, a deleterious mutation can be compensated by about nine different intragenic compensatory mutations. We estimate that about half of all compensatory mutations are located extragenically in this organism.},

According to many theoretical models, recombination can increase the rate of adaptation by restoring genetic variation. However, the potential for genetic drift to generate conditions that produce this outcome has yet to be studied experimentally. We have designed and performed an experiment that reveals the effects of drift on existing genetic variation by minimizing the influence of variation on beneficial mutation rate. Our experiment was conducted in populations of RNA bacteriophage Phi6 initiated from a common source population at varying bottleneck sizes. The segmented genome of this virus results in genetic exchange between viruses that co-infect the same host cell. In response to selection for growth in a high-temperature environment, sexual lines outperformed their asexual counterparts on average. The advantage of sex attenuated with increasing effective population size, implying that the rate of adaptation was limited by clonal interference among segments caused by drift. This is the first empirical evidence that the advantage of sex during adaptation increases with the intensity of drift.},

How many different compensatory mutations can act on a given deleterious mutation? Although this quantity is fundamentally important to understanding the evolutionary consequence of mutation and the genetic complexity of adaptation, it remains poorly understood. To determine the shape of the statistical distribution for the number of compensatory mutations per deleterious mutation, we have performed a maximum-likelihood analysis of experimental data collected from the suppressor mutation literature. Suppressor mutations are used widely to assess protein interactions and are under certain conditions equivalent to compensatory mutations. By comparing the maximum likelihood of a variety of candidate distribution functions, we established that an L-shaped gamma distribution (alpha=0.564, theta=21.01) is the most successful at explaining the collected data. This distribution predicts an average of 11.8 compensatory mutations per deleterious mutation. Furthermore, the success of the L-shaped gamma distribution is robust to variation in mutation rates among sites. We have detected significant differences among viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic data subsets in the number of compensatory mutations and also in the proportion of compensatory mutations that are intragenic. This is the first attempt to characterize the overall diversity of compensatory mutations, identifying a consistent and accurate prior distribution of compensatory mutation diversity for theoretical evolutionary models.},

In Fisher's model, a population evolves in an n-dimensional character space with an adaptive optimum at the origin. The model allows us to investigate compensatory mutations, which restore fitness losses incurred by other mutations, in a context-dependent manner. We have conducted a moment analysis of the model, supplemented by the numerical results of computer simulations. The mean reduction of fitness (i.e., expected load) scaled to one is approximately n/(n+2Ne), where Ne is the effective population size. The reciprocal relationship between the load and Ne implies that the fixation of deleterious mutations is unlikely to cause extinction when there is a broad scope for compensatory mutations, except in very small populations. Furthermore, the dependence of load on n implies that pleiotropy plays a large role in determining the extinction risk of small populations. Differences and similarities between our results and those of a previous study on the effects of Ne and n are explored. That the predictions of this model are qualitatively different from studies ignoring compensatory mutations implies that we must be cautious in predicting the evolutionary fate of small populations and that additional data on the nature of mutations is of critical importance.},

Genetic clustering methods are becoming increasingly popular for molecular epidemiology, especially in the context of HIV where there is now considerable interest in applying these methods to prioritize groups for public health resources such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. To date, genetic clustering has generally been performed with ad hoc algorithms, only some of which have since been encoded and distributed as free software. These algorithms have seldom been validated on simulated data where clusters are known, and their interpretation and similarities are not transparent to users outside of the field. Here, I provide a brief overview on the development and inter-relationships of genetic clustering methods, and an evaluation of six methods on data simulated under an epidemic model in a risk-structured population. The simulation analysis demonstrates that the majority of clustering methods are systematically biased to detect variation in sampling rates among subpopulations, not variation in transmission rates. I discuss these results in the context of previous work and the implications for public health applications of genetic clustering.},

Phylodynamic inference attempts to reverse this flow of information, estimating parameters of these processes from the shape of a virus phylogeny reconstructed from a sample of genetic sequences from the epidemic. A key challenge to phylodynamic inference is quantifying the similarity between two trees in an efficient and comprehensive way. In this study, I demonstrate that a new distance measure, based on a subset tree kernel function from computational linguistics, confers a significant improvement over previous measures of tree shape for classifying trees generated under different epidemiological scenarios. Next, I incorporate this kernel-based distance measure into an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework for phylodynamic inference. ABC bypasses the need for an analytical solution of model likelihood, as it only requires the ability to simulate data from the model. I validate this "kernel-ABC" method for phylodynamic inference by estimating parameters from data simulated under a simple epidemiological model. Results indicate that kernel-ABC attained greater accuracy for parameters associated with virus transmission than leading software on the same data sets. Finally, I apply the kernel-ABC framework to study a recent outbreak of a recombinant HIV subtype in China. Kernel-ABC provides a versatile framework for phylodynamic inference because it can fit a broader range of models than methods that rely on the computation of exact likelihoods.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes often carry one or more mutations associated with drug resistance upon transmission into a therapy-na{\"\i}ve individual. We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in chronically-infected therapy-na{\"\i}ve patients enrolled in a multi-center cohort in North America. Pre-therapy clinical significance was quantified by plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4+ cell count (CD4) at baseline. Na{\"\i}ve bulk sequences of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were screened for resistance mutations as defined by the World Health Organization surveillance list. The overall prevalence of TDR was 14.2\%. We used a Bayesian network to identify co-transmission of TDR mutations in clusters associated with specific drugs or drug classes. Aggregate effects of mutations by drug class were estimated by fitting linear models of pVL and CD4 on weighted sums over TDR mutations according to the Stanford HIV Database algorithm. Transmitted resistance to both classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors was significantly associated with lower CD4, but had opposing effects on pVL. In contrast, position-specific analyses of TDR mutations revealed substantial effects on CD4 and pVL at several residue positions that were being masked in the aggregate analyses, and significant interaction effects as well. Residue positions in RT with predominant effects on CD4 or pVL (D67 and M184) were re-evaluated in causal models using an inverse probability-weighting scheme to address the problem of confounding by other mutations and demographic or risk factors. We found that causal effect estimates of mutations M184V/I (-1.7 log₁₀pVL) and D67N/G (-2.1[³√CD4] and 0.4 log₁₀pVL) were compensated by K103N/S and K219Q/E/N/R.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e.g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, M{\'e}xico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits. CONCLUSIONS: SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.},

  Abstract                 = {Epistasis is an important and poorly understood aspect of mutations and strongly influences the evolutionary impact of genetic variation on adaptation and fitness. Although recent studies have begun to characterize the distribution of epistatic effects between mutations affecting fitness, there is currently a lack of empirical information on the underlying biological causes of these epistatic interactions. What are the functional constraints that determine the effectiveness of a compensatory mutation at restoring fitness? We have measured the effect-sizes of 52 compensatory mutations affecting nine different deleterious mutations in the major capsid and spike proteins of the DNA bacteriophage phiX174. On average, an experimentally detectable compensatory mutation recovers about two-thirds of the fitness cost of the preceding deleterious mutation. Variation in fitness effect-sizes is only weakly associated with measures of the distance separating the deleterious and compensatory mutations in the amino acid sequence or the folded protein structure. However, there is a strong association of fitness effect-size with the correlation in the effects of the mutations on the biochemical properties of amino acids. A compensatory mutation has the largest effect-size, on average, when both the compensatory and deleterious mutations have radical effects on the overall biochemical make-up of the amino acids. By examining the relative contributions of specific biochemical properties to variation in fitness effect-size, we find that the area and charge of amino acids have a major influence, which suggests that the complexity of the amino acid phenotype is simplified by selection into a reduced number of phenotypic components.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: HIV evolves rapidly and therefore infections with similar genetic sequences are likely linked by recent transmission events. Clusters of related infections can represent subpopulations with high rates of transmission. We describe the implementation of an automated near real-time system to monitor and characterise HIV transmission hotspots in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: In this implementation case study, we applied a monitoring system to the British Columbia drug treatment database, which holds more than 32 000 anonymised HIV genotypes for nearly 9000 residents of British Columbia living with HIV. On average, five to six new HIV genotypes are deposited in the database every day, which triggers an automated reanalysis of the entire database. We extracted clusters of five or more individuals with short phylogenetic distances between their respective HIV sequences. The system generated monthly reports of the growth and characteristics of clusters that were distributed to public health officers. FINDINGS: In June, 2014, the monitoring system detected the expansion of a cluster by 11 new cases during 3 months, including eight cases with transmitted drug resistance. This cluster generally comprised young men who have sex with men. The subsequent report precipitated an enhanced public health follow-up to ensure linkage to care and treatment initiation in the affected subpopulation. Of the nine cases associated with this follow-up, all had already been linked to care and five cases had started treatment. Subsequent to the follow-up, three additional cases started treatment and most cases achieved suppressed viral loads. During the next 12 months, we detected 12 new cases in this cluster with reduction in the onward transmission of drug resistance. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show the first application of an automated phylogenetic system monitoring a clinical database to detect a recent HIV outbreak and support the ensuing public health response. By making secondary use of routinely collected HIV genotypes, this approach is cost-effective, attains near real-time monitoring of new cases, and can be implemented in all settings in which HIV genotyping is the standard of care.

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: The diversification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is shaped by its transmission history. We therefore used a population based province wide HIV drug resistance database in British Columbia (BC), Canada, to evaluate the impact of clinical, demographic, and behavioral factors on rates of HIV transmission. METHODS: We reconstructed molecular phylogenies from 27,296 anonymized bulk HIV pol sequences representing 7747 individuals in BC-about half the estimated HIV prevalence in BC. Infections were grouped into clusters based on phylogenetic distances, as a proxy for variation in transmission rates. Rates of cluster expansion were reconstructed from estimated dates of HIV seroconversion. RESULTS: Our criteria grouped 4431 individuals into 744 clusters largely separated with respect to risk factors, including large established clusters predominated by injection drug users and more-recently emerging clusters comprising men who have sex with men. The mean log10 viral load of an individual's phylogenetic neighborhood (composed of 5 other individuals with shortest phylogenetic distances) increased their odds of appearing in a cluster by >2-fold per log10 viruses per milliliter. CONCLUSIONS: Hotspots of ongoing HIV transmission can be characterized in near real time by the secondary analysis of HIV resistance genotypes, providing an important potential resource for targeting public health initiatives for HIV prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) perform a critical role in the immune control of viral infections, including those caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). As a result, genetic variation at CTL epitopes is strongly influenced by host-specific selection for either escape from the immune response, or reversion due to the replicative costs of escape mutations in the absence of CTL recognition. Under strong CTL-mediated selection, codon positions within epitopes may immediately "toggle" in response to each host, such that genetic variation in the circulating virus population is shaped by rapid adaptation to immune variation in the host population. However, this hypothesis neglects the substantial genetic variation that accumulates in virus populations within hosts. Here, we evaluate this quantity for a large number of HIV-1- (n > or = 3,000) and HCV-infected patients (n > or = 2,600) by screening bulk RT-PCR sequences for sequencing "mixtures" (i.e., ambiguous nucleotides), which act as site-specific markers of genetic variation within each host. We find that nonsynonymous mixtures are abundant and significantly associated with codon positions under host-specific CTL selection, which should deplete within-host variation by driving the fixation of the favored variant. Using a simple model, we demonstrate that this apparently contradictory outcome can be explained by the transmission of unfavorable variants to new hosts before they are removed by selection, which occurs more frequently when selection and transmission occur on similar time scales. Consequently, the circulating virus population is shaped by the transmission rate and the disparity in selection intensities for escape or reversion as much as it is shaped by the immune diversity of the host population, with potentially serious implications for vaccine design.},

  Abstract                 = {Resistance genotyping provides an important resource for the clinical management of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, resistance to protease (PR) inhibitors (PIs) is a complex phenotype shaped by interactions among nearly half of the residues in HIV-1 PR. Previous studies of the genetic basis of PI resistance focused on fixed substitutions among populations of HIV-1, i.e., host-specific adaptations. Consequently, they are susceptible to a high false discovery rate due to founder effects. Here, we employ sequencing "mixtures" (i.e., ambiguous base calls) as a site-specific marker of genetic variation within patients that is independent of the phylogeny. We demonstrate that the transient response to selection by PIs is manifested as an excess of nonsynonymous mixtures. Using a sample of 5,651 PR sequences isolated from both PI-naive and -treated patients, we analyze the joint distribution of mixtures and eight PIs as a Bayesian network, which distinguishes residue-residue interactions from direct associations with PIs. We find that selection for resistance is associated with the emergence of nonsynonymous mixtures in two distinct groups of codon sites clustered along the substrate cleft and distal regions of PR, respectively. Within-patient evolution at several positions is independent of PIs, including those formerly postulated to be involved in resistance. These positions are under strong positive selection in the PI-naive patient population, implying that other factors can produce spurious associations with resistance, e.g., mutational escape from the immune response.},

  Abstract                 = {The addition of asparagine (N)-linked polysaccharide chains (i.e., glycans) to the gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is not only required for correct protein folding, but also may provide protection against neutralizing antibodies as a "glycan shield." As a result, strong host-specific selection is frequently associated with codon positions where nonsynonymous substitutions can create or disrupt potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs). Moreover, empirical data suggest that the individual contribution of PNGSs to the neutralization sensitivity or infectivity of HIV-1 may be critically dependent on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the envelope sequence. Here we evaluate how glycan-glycan interactions have shaped the evolution of HIV-1 envelope sequences by analyzing the distribution of PNGSs in a large-sequence alignment. Using a "covarion"-type phylogenetic model, we find that the rates at which individual PNGSs are gained or lost vary significantly over time, suggesting that the selective advantage of having a PNGS may depend on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the sequence. Consequently, we identify specific interactions between PNGSs in the alignment using a new paired-character phylogenetic model of evolution, and a Bayesian graphical model. Despite the fundamental differences between these two methods, several interactions are jointly identified by both. Mapping these interactions onto a structural model of HIV-1 gp120 reveals that negative (exclusive) interactions occur significantly more often between colocalized glycans, while positive (inclusive) interactions are restricted to more distant glycans. Our results imply that the adaptive repertoire of alternative configurations in the HIV-1 glycan shield is limited by functional interactions between the N-linked glycans. This represents a potential vulnerability of rapidly evolving HIV-1 populations that may provide useful glycan-based targets for neutralizing antibodies.},

  Abstract                 = {The third variable loop (V3) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is a principal determinant of antibody neutralization and progression to AIDS. Although it is undoubtedly an important target for vaccine research, extensive genetic variation in V3 remains an obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine. Comparative methods that exploit the abundance of sequence data can detect interactions between residues of rapidly evolving proteins such as the HIV-1 envelope, revealing biological constraints on their variability. However, previous studies have relied implicitly on two biologically unrealistic assumptions: (1) that founder effects in the evolutionary history of the sequences can be ignored, and; (2) that statistical associations between residues occur exclusively in pairs. We show that comparative methods that neglect the evolutionary history of extant sequences are susceptible to a high rate of false positives (20\%-40\%). Therefore, we propose a new method to detect interactions that relaxes both of these assumptions. First, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of extant sequences by maximum likelihood, shifting focus from extant sequence variation to the underlying substitution events. Second, we analyze the joint distribution of substitution events among positions in the sequence as a Bayesian graphical model, in which each branch in the phylogeny is a unit of observation. We perform extensive validation of our models using both simulations and a control case of known interactions in HIV-1 protease, and apply this method to detect interactions within V3 from a sample of 1,154 HIV-1 envelope sequences. Our method greatly reduces the number of false positives due to founder effects, while capturing several higher-order interactions among V3 residues. By mapping these interactions to a structural model of the V3 loop, we find that the loop is stratified into distinct evolutionary clusters. We extend our model to detect interactions between the V3 and C4 domains of the HIV-1 envelope, and account for the uncertainty in mapping substitutions to the tree with a parametric bootstrap.},

  Abstract                 = {At the early stage of infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 predominantly uses the CCR5 coreceptor for host cell entry. The subsequent emergence of HIV variants that use the CXCR4 coreceptor in roughly half of all infections is associated with an accelerated decline of CD4+ T-cells and rate of progression to AIDS. The presence of a 'fitness valley' separating CCR5- and CXCR4-using genotypes is postulated to be a biological determinant of whether the HIV coreceptor switch occurs. Using phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of HIV within hosts enables us to discriminate between competing models of this process. We have developed a phylogenetic pipeline for the molecular clock analysis, ancestral reconstruction, and visualization of deep sequence data. These data were generated by next-generation sequencing of HIV RNA extracted from longitudinal serum samples (median 7 time points) from 8 untreated subjects with chronic HIV infections (Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV-1 infection and AIDS). We used the known dates of sampling to directly estimate rates of evolution and to map ancestral mutations to a reconstructed timeline in units of days. HIV coreceptor usage was predicted from reconstructed ancestral sequences using the geno2pheno algorithm. We determined that the first mutations contributing to CXCR4 use emerged about 16 (per subject range 4 to 30) months before the earliest predicted CXCR4-using ancestor, which preceded the first positive cell-based assay of CXCR4 usage by 10 (range 5 to 25) months. CXCR4 usage arose in multiple lineages within 5 of 8 subjects, and ancestral lineages following alternate mutational pathways before going extinct were common. We observed highly patient-specific distributions and time-scales of mutation accumulation, implying that the role of a fitness valley is contingent on the genotype of the transmitted variant.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapidly evolving viruses such as HIV-1 display extensive sequence variation in response to host-specific selection, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity. This apparent conflict between diversifying and purifying selection may be resolved by an abundance of epistatic interactions such that the same functional requirements can be met by highly divergent sequences. We investigate this hypothesis by conducting an extensive characterization of sequence variation in the HIV-1 nef gene that encodes a highly variable multifunctional protein. Population-based sequences were obtained from 686 patients enrolled in the HOMER cohort in British Columbia, Canada, from which the distribution of nonsynonymous substitutions in the phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihood. We used a phylogenetic comparative method on these data to identify putative epistatic interactions between residues. Two interactions (Y120/Q125 and N157/S169) were chosen to further investigate within-host evolution using HIV-1 RNA extractions from plasma samples from eight patients. Clonal sequencing confirmed strong linkage between polymorphisms at these sites in every case. We used massively parallel pyrosequencing (MPP) to reconstruct within-host evolution in these patients. Experimental error associated with MPP was quantified by performing replicates at two different stages of the protocol, which were pooled prior to analysis to reduce this source of variation. Phylogenetic reconstruction from these data revealed correlated substitutions at Y120/Q125 or N157/S169 repeated across multiple lineages in every host, indicating convergent within-host evolution shaped by epistatic interactions.},

  abstract      = {A phylogeny is a tree-based model of common ancestry that is an indispensable tool for studying biological variation. Phylogenies play a special role in the study of rapidly evolving populations such as viruses, where the proliferation of lineages is constantly being shaped by the mode of virus transmission, by adaptation to immune systems, and by patterns of human migration and contact. These processes may leave an imprint on the shapes of virus phylogenies that can be extracted for comparative study; however, tree shapes are intrinsically difficult to quantify. Here we present a comprehensive study of phylogenies reconstructed from 38 different RNA viruses from 12 taxonomic families that are associated with human pathologies. To accomplish this, we have developed a new procedure for studying phylogenetic tree shapes based on the 'kernel trick', a technique that maps complex objects into a statistically convenient space. We show that our kernel method outperforms nine different tree balance statistics at correctly classifying phylogenies that were simulated under different evolutionary scenarios. Using the kernel method, we observe patterns in the distribution of RNA virus phylogenies in this space that reflect modes of transmission and pathogenesis. For example, viruses that can establish persistent chronic infections (such as HIV and hepatitis C virus) form a distinct cluster. Although the visibly 'star-like' shape characteristic of trees from these viruses has been well-documented, we show that established methods for quantifying tree shape fail to distinguish these trees from those of other viruses. The kernel approach presented here potentially represents an important new tool for characterizing the evolution and epidemiology of RNA viruses.},

  abstract      = {Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90\%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods' development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.},

Screening for CD8(+) T cell responses revealed that each of these recombination sites (approximately 50 aa) encompassed distinct regions containing two immunodominant CD8 epitopes (B27-KK10 in Gag and Cw1-CL9 in Env). Viral escape and the subsequent development of variant-specific de novo CD8(+) T cell responses against both epitopes were illustrative of the significant immune selection pressures exerted by both responses. Comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of CD8 responses and viral evolution indicated that the recombination events quickly facilitated viral escape from both dominant WT- and variant-specific responses. These data suggest that the ability of a superinfecting strain of HIV to overcome preexisting immune control may be related to its ability to rapidly recombine in critical regions under immune selection pressure. These data also support a role for cellular immune pressures in driving the selection of new recombinant forms of HIV.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: A tropism test is required before administration of the antiretroviral drug maraviroc. However, plasma RNA testing is not possible in patients with undetectable plasma viral loads. Here we assess genotypic testing of cellular human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to predict virologic responses in treatment-experienced patients beginning maraviroc-containing regimens. METHODS: PBMC samples from 181 maraviroc recipients at study entry in MOTIVATE or A4001029 (51\% R5 by original Trofile). The V3 loop was amplified in triplicate from cellular HIV DNA, and matching plasma RNA (n = 156). Sequencing was performed using standard population-based methods and next-generation deep sequencing, with tropism assessment as previously defined. RESULTS: Genotypic DNA-based tropism testing from the cellular compartment had 78\%-81\% sensitivity relative to RNA-based Trofile at the same time point. Cell-based genotypic tropism methods and plasma-based phenotypic and genotypic methods were predictive of virologic response. However, when classifications were discordant, the outcomes favored the plasma predictions over the DNA ones. CONCLUSIONS: Genotypic determination of HIV tropism can be performed using cell-derived viral DNA, and is a predictor of virologic success on maraviroc in therapy-experienced patients. However, the PBMC compartment appears to be a suboptimal predictor compared to plasma.},
